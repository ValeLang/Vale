# Vale

Vale is a programming language that's aims to be not only **fast** and **memory-safe**, but also **easy and flexible**.

* **Fast:** Vale is AOT compiled to LLVM, statically-typed, and uses the new [generational references](https://verdagon.dev/blog/generational-references) technique for memory safety with speed and flexibility, and will soon have [region borrow checking](https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-refs-regions) to make it even faster.
 * **Safe:** It is the [safest native language](https://vale.dev/memory-safe), thanks to [generational references](https://verdagon.dev/blog/generational-references) and [Fearless FFI](https://verdagon.dev/blog/fearless-ffi).
 * **Easy:** Vale has memory-safe single ownership without garbage collection or a borrow checker, which makes it easy to write safe, fast code.


See http://vale.dev/ for more information on the language. We're also open for [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ValeLang), thank you to all our sponsors for enabling our ambitious endeavor!

## Building a Vale Program

 1. Download the latest binary from https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/releases
 1. Unzip it into, for example, `~/Vale`, and `cd` into it.
 1. Make a file `hello.vale` containing some vale code, like `exported func main() { println("Hello world!"); }`
 1. Compile a program: `./valec build mymod=hello.vale --output_dir target`
 1. Run the program: `target/main`, and you should see the output `Hello world!`


## Learning Vale

See [the Guide](https://vale.dev/guide/introduction) for how to use Vale.

# Notes

Vale started in January 2013, and back then we called it "VLang", though there's now another language with that name. We then called it GelLLVM, in honor of Gel, the first language to offer constraint references. Since then, we've settled on the name "Vale". Note that Vale and Vala are two different languages.
