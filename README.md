# Vale Compiler

Compiler for the Vale programming language.


## Vale

Vale is the fast, fearless, and flexible programming language. It aims to be as fast as Rust, while being as easy as Java, as safe as Javascript.

See http://vale.dev/ for samples and more information on the language!


## Building and Running

For instructions for building the compiler itself, see:

 * [Building the Vale Compiler (Linux)](build-linux.md)
 * [Building the Vale Compiler (Mac)](build-mac.md)
 * [Building the Vale Compiler (Windows)](build-windows.md)

# Notes

Vale started in January 2013, and back then we called it "VLang", though there's now another language with that name. We then called it GelLLVM, in honor of Gel, the first language to offer constraint references. Since then, we've settled on the name "Vale". Note that Vale and Vala are two different languages.
