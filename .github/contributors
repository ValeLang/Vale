# This is a scratch file for people to commit to, so that their subsequent PRs can run our CI, the GitHub Actions workflows.
# 
# Why is this needed? It's because Github only allows people to trigger CI runs if they've previously contributed to a project.
#
# So, just:
#  1. Make a new SEPARATE pull request, containing a change to this file.
#  2. We'll approve and merge in that PR.
#
# And now, GitHub trusts you to run CI on your other PR!

# These people are awesome:
